                  These Terms of Use (hereinafter referred to as "ToU") apply to

                  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for collaboratively creating,
                  editing, and sharing presentations (hereinafter referred to as

                  GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (hereinafter referred to
                  as "Pitch"). Free services offered by Pitch address both
                  consumers (Verbraucher) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil
                  Code, and businesses (Unternehmer) pursuant to Section 14
                  German Civil Code. Paid Plans (as defined in Section 3.2) are
                  offered exclusively to companies or persons that legally
                  qualify as entrepreneurs (Unternehmer) (the respective
                  customer hereinafter referred to as "Customer", together with

                  For the avoidance of doubt: The Customer is a consumer
                  (Verbraucher) insofar as the purpose of the subscribed
                  services is predominantly outside his trade, business or
                  profession. On the other hand, an entrepreneur (Unternehmer)
                  is any natural or legal person or partnership with legal
                  personality who or which, when concluding the Contract, acts
                  in the exercise of his or its trade, business or profession.

                  Deviations from these ToU shall only be considered agreed if
                  they have expressly been confirmed in writing by Pitch. In
                  particular, the mere omission of an objection by Pitch against
                  any general terms and conditions of the Customer shall not
                  cause such terms and conditions to be considered agreed. This
                  shall also apply if Pitch performs Services unconditionally
                  upon knowledge of opposing terms and conditions of the
                  Customer or terms and conditions diverging from these ToU.

                  For important reasons, in particular in the event of changes
                  to statutory provisions, judicial precedences, the Software or
                  market conditions, Pitch may notify the Customer of amendments
                  to these ToU. The amended ToU shall be deemed to have been
                  agreed if the Customer has not objected to the amendment
                  within one month upon receipt of the notification and Pitch
                  has explicitly notified the Customer of this consequence.
                  Regardless of the foregoing, changes to the scope of the
                  Contractual Service (Umfang der geschuldeten Leistungen)
                  require the express consent of the Customer.

                  accepts the then current versions of Pitch’s ToU, privacy
